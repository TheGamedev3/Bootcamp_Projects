# Elevator Pitch

Hey! Hello, I’m Aaron. (*friendly inconspicuous chuckle, grin, make eye contact*)
I’m a full stack software-dev fresh from bootcamp with tons of hands on experience on several different projects & frameworks.
I have proficiency in databases, Next JS, and website pages. (do the finger listing count thing, going 1, 2, 3)
I’m always committed to evolving, and I can handle any problem you throw my way! Writing clean secure code, database or route quirks, & refactoring, you name it! (say with confidence) (do the finger listing count thing, going 1, 2, 3)
I’m really looking for an entry level position that I could put my skills to the test at, and gain experience in for my career. I see you’ve been hiring, I’d love to contribute to your company! (emphasize the word contribute and really look at them nodding at the end, to make it all about how they’ll be benefiting from you)
