    - description back button
    - create forum
        - making a magic forum
        - maybe some dummy template ships
    - hover profile to destroy ship
        - requires a hover button
    - destroy ship button in the description

Moving Ship
    - click to queue up a planet or spacecraft for processing
    - logic for that to work
    - const [selected, selectMe] = useMoveSelection(planet) hook

Create Tests afterwards
    - minitests for planet element, and the ship element
    - navigate the through the pages (just simulate the whole entire site)
    - finding ships/planets tests
    - moving ships to planets test
    - create/destroy a ship test
